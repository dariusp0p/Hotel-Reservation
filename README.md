- complex CRUD app with undo/redo, save options and multiple domains
- GUI with Qt

Brainstorm

- hotel -> rooms, reservations, room layout
- room -> number, capacity
- reservation
      -> room nr, guest name, nr of guests, check-in date, check-out date
      -> search by: room nr O(1), guest name O(1), check-in/out date O(1)
